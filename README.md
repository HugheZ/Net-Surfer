## The Game

It's the distant past's future, and you are Axel-Lee.exe, a cyber ninja robot cop... from the future. Your task, should you choose to accept it, is to patrol the internet's conduits for malware and bad actors. Obliterate the threats without hesitation.

This was a single-sprint project with the same partner as Communisuto Damacy, but with a more laid-back feel. All models and animations were in-house (save for the guitar) and all sprites were made by me. Outline shaders were adapted from existing shader code available on the Unity asset store.
