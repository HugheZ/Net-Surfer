Run Note:
This game must be opened in the 2018 version of the Unity editor. Rendering has changed and the glitch effect will block the camera's view. Until the author of the glitch effect changes, we cannot upgrade the project to 2019.

To run on the student laptops, we reccomend running on the lower quality settings anda t 720p resolution.
